# Ride Price Estimation ML Project

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning system to estimate ride prices using trip features.

## Dataset
Synthetic dataset of 200 rides with numerical and categorical features.

## Features Used
- Distance
- Duration
- Time of day
- Traffic level
- Weather condition
- Demand level
- Passengers

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

## Key Findings
Distance and duration were the strongest predictors of ride price. 
Logistic regression successfully classified rides into high-cost and low-cost categories.
